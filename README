curl for android demo.

how to generate libcurl:
0. download aosp (part of it should be ok)

1. generate libc, libssl, liblog, and so
   shell> make libssl liblog
2. edit jni/configure.sh, change the default settings:
   read the script carefully..normally you can keep it as is
3. run curl-android/jni/configure.sh
   if there are any error, check and fix...
4. generate libcurl
   shell> ndk-build ANDROID_SOURCE=$ANDROID_SOURCE
